## 🛠 Customize

* To **adjust difficulty**, change `wave_length` or `enemy_vel`.
* To **add more power-ups or enemies**, simply create additional subclasses in `game_classes`.

---

## 🔹 Notes

✅ The game uses **Vosk's small English model for faster, lightweight voice recognition**.
✅ The recognizer runs in a separate thread to avoid blocking the main game loop.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

➥ If you find your voice controls laggy or unreliable:

* Try a quieter room.
* Use a headset.
* Reduce background noise.

➥ If you get an `ImportError` or `ModuleNotFoundError`:

* Make sure you installed all requirements and downloaded the Vosk model.
